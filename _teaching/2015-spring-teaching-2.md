As the lecturer for **ECE 398**, I designed and led **laboratory sessions integrating virtual reality (VR) environments** to help students visualize and interact with electromagnetic field phenomena introduced in **ECE 329 (Fields and Waves I)**.  

I guided experiments that allowed students to **explore wave propagation, reflection, and field distributions** in immersive 3D settings, bridging theory with spatial intuition. My duties included **creating instructional material**, **supervising lab activities**, and **assessing student performance** through hands-on exercises and concept-based evaluations.  

This course emphasized the use of **interactive visualization** as a pedagogical tool to strengthen studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding of electromagnetics.
