As an office hour Teaching Assistant for **ECE 329 (Fields and Waves I)**, I provided one-on-one and small-group guidance to undergraduate students on topics including **electromagnetic wave propagation, transmission lines, boundary conditions, and Maxwellâ€™s equations**. I assisted students in developing both **physical intuition and mathematical rigor**, helping them connect abstract field concepts to real-world engineering applications.  

My role also involved **clarifying lecture material**, **supporting homework and exam preparation**, and **reinforcing problem-solving strategies** through discussion and step-by-step derivations.
