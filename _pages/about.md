## About Me

I am **Pedro Silva**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the **University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign**, advised by **Prof. Raluca Ilie**. My research focuses on **computational modeling of the Earth’s inner magnetosphere**, particularly on how **heavy ions shape ring current decay and plasmaspheric refilling** during geomagnetic storms.  

I develop and extend the **HEIDI** (Hot Electron–Ion Drift Integrator) model — a **kinetic model** that couples to the **BATS-R-US MHD code** within the **Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF)**. My work integrates **physics-based simulation**, **high-performance computing**. I am also interested in emerging **AI techniques** such as **graph neural networks** and **diffusion-based surrogate models** to accelerate and enhance space weather prediction.  

Beyond my core research, I am interested in the broader intersection of **HPC, machine learning, and space physics**, aiming to create models that bridge physical fidelity with computational scalability.
